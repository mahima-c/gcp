Task 1: Install the Cloud SDK for App Engine
Run the following command to install the gcloud component that includes the App Engine extension for Python 3.7:

    gcloud components install app-engine-python

Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

    gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.

Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

Navigate to the source directory:

  cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python37/hello_world

Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
  In this task, you run the Hello World application in a local, virtual environment in Cloud Shell.

  Ensure that you are at the Cloud Shell command prompt.

  Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

  sudo apt-get update

  Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.

  Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

  sudo apt-get install virtualenv

  virtualenv -p python3 venv


  Activate the virtual environment.

  source venv/bin/activate

  Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

  pip install  -r requirements.txt

  Run the application:

  python main.py

  In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.




Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Dashboard.

Notice that no resources are deployed.

Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:

Navigate to the source directory:

  cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python37/hello_world

Deploy your Hello World application.

  gcloud app deploy


Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

  gcloud app browse




Task 4: Disable the application
App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed, although you could instead replace the application with a simple page that says something like "not in service."

However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.

Click Disable application.

Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.

If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
